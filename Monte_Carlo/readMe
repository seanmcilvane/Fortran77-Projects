The program monte.f is a Fortran77 program that estimates the value of pi using the Monte Carlo method. 
monte.f uses a multiplicative linear congruential generator to generate sets of random coordinates.
Pi is then estimated by counting the proportion of random points that land inside a circle that is inscribed in square.
